# User guide

## Getting started

### Requirements

*connect-openapi-client* runs on python 3.7 or later.

### Install

*connect-openapi-client* is a small python package that can be installed
from the [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/connect-openapi-client/) repository.

```
$ pip install connect-openapi-client
```

## First steps with Connect Python OpenAPI Client

### Create a client instance

To use *connect-openapi-client* first of all you have to create an instance of the `ConnectClient` object:

```python
from connect.client import ConnectClient

client = ConnectClient('ApiKey SU-000-000-000:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
```

### Access to namespaces and collections

The `ConnectClient` instance allows access to collections of resources using the
`collection()` method of the client:

```python
products = client.collection('products')
```

The previous call to the `collection()` method returns a
`Collection` object that allows working with the resources that contain.

Some collections of the CloudBlue Connect ReST API are grouped within a namespace.

To access a namespace the client exposes the `ns()` method:

```python
subscriptions = client.ns('subscriptions')
```

Since *Connect Python OpenAPI Client* has been designed following the fluent interface design pattern,
you can chain methods:

```python
assets = client.ns('subscriptions').collection('assets')
```

This previous previous expression can be written in a more concise way:

```python
assets = client('subscriptions').assets
```

**NOTE**: For collections that use a dash in their names, it is yet
possible to use the concise form by replacing the dash character with an underscore.

## Working with resources

### Create a new resource

To create a new resource inside a collection you can invoke the
`create()` method on the corresponding
`Collection` instance:

```python
payload = {
    'name': 'My Awesome Product',
    'category': {
        'id': 'CAT-00000',
    },
}

new_product = c.products.create(payload=payload)
```

This returns the newly created object json-decoded.

### Access to a resource

To access a resource within a collection you can use the
`resource()` method on the corresponding
`Collection` instance:

```python
product = client.products.resource('PRD-000-000-000')
```

The indexing operator allows to write the previous expression the following way:

```python
product = client.products['PRD-000-000-000']
```

The previous expression returns a `Resource` object.

### Retrieve a resource

To retrieve a resource from within a collection you have to invoke
the `get()` method of the
`Resource` object as shown below:

```python
product = client.products['PRD-000-000-000'].get()
```

This call returns the json-decoded object or raise an exception
if it does not exist.

### Update a resource

To update a resource of the collection using its primary identifier,
you can invoke the `update()` method as shown below:

```python
payload = {
    'short_description': 'This is the short description',
    'detailed_description': 'This is the detailed description',
}

product = client.products['PRD-000-000-000'].update(payload=payload)
```

### Delete a resource

To delete a resource the `delete()` method is exposed:

```python
client.products['PRD-000-000-000'].delete()
```

### Access to an action

To access an action that can be performed on a resource you can use
the `action()` method of the
`Resource` object:

```python
endsale_action = client.products['PRD-000-000-000'].action('endsale')
```

or directly using the call operator
on the `Resource` class passing the name of the action:

```python
endsale_action = client.products['PRD-000-000-000']('endsale')
```

This returns an `Action` object.

### Execute an action on a resource

Depending on its nature, an action can be exposed using the HTTP method that
best gives the sense of the action to perform.
The `Action` object exposes the
`get()`, `post()`,
`put()`, and `delete()`
methods.

For example, supose you want to execute the **endsale** action:

```python
payload = {
    'replacement': {
        'id': 'PRD-111-111-111'
    },
    'end_of_sale_notes': 'stopped manufacturing',
}

result = client.products['PRD-000-000-000']('endsale').post(payload=payload)
```

### Access nested namespaces

Nested namespaces can be accessed chaining calls of the ns method:

```python
nested_namespace = client.ns('root_ns').ns('child_ns')
```

or shortly:

```python
nested_namespace = client('root_ns')('child_ns')
```

### Access nested collections

If you want to access a nested collection, you can do that both using the
`collection()` method or the
name of the nested collection on the `Resource` object:

```python
product_item = client.products['PRD-000-000-000'].items
```

As for root collections, you can use the `create()`
method to create new resources within the nested collection or you can use the
indexing operator to access a resource of the nested collection by ID.

## Querying collections

You can perform queries on a collection to retrieve a set of resources that
match the filters specified in the query.

The Connect ReST API use the [Resource Query Language](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/api/rql/)
or RQL, to perform queries on a collection.

**NOTE**: This guide assumes you are somewhat familiar with RQL.
If not, take a look at the [RQL video tutorial here](https://connect.cloudblue.com/community/api/rql/#Video_Tutorial).

The `ResourceSet` object helps both to express RQL queries and to manipulate the resulting set of resources.

### Create a `ResourceSet` object

A `connect.client.models.ResourceSet` object can be created through
the corresponding `connect.client.models.Collection` object
using the `connect.client.models.Collection.all()` method to access
all the resources of the collection:

```python
products = client.products.all()
```

Or applying filter using the `connect.client.models.Collection.filter()` method:

```python
products = client.products.filter(status='published')
```

The `ResourceSet` will not be evaluated until you need the resources data,
i.e. it does not make any HTTP call until needed, to help express more complex queries
using method chaining like in the following example:

```python
products = client.products.filter(status='published').order_by('-created')
```

### Count results

To get the total number of resources represented by a `ResourceSet` you can use
the `connect.client.models.ResourceSet.count()` method.

```python
no_of_published = client.products.filter(status='published').count()
```

or

```python
total = client.products.all().count()
```

### First result

To get the first resource represented by a `ResourceSet` you can use
the `connect.client.models.ResourceSet.first()` method.

```python
first = client.products.all().first()
```

or

```python
first = client.products.filter(status='published').first()
```

### Filtering resources

The `connect.client.models.ResourceSet` object offers three way to define
your RQL query filters:

#### Using raw RQL filter expressions

You can express your filters using raw RQL expressions like in this example:

```python
products = client.products.filter('ilike(name,*awesome*)', 'in(status,(draft,published))')
```

Arguments will be joined using the `and` logical operator.

#### Using kwargs and the `__` (double underscore) notation

You can use the `__` notation at the end of the name of the keyword argument
to specify which RQL operator to apply:

```python
products = client.products.filter(name__ilike='*awesome*', status__in=('draft', 'published'))
```

The lookups expressed through keyword arguments are `and`-ed togheter.

Chaning the filter method combine filters using `and`. Equivalent to the previous
expression is to write:

```python
products = client.products.filter(name__ilike='*awesome*').filter(status__in=('draft', 'published'))
```

The `__` notation allow also to specify nested fields for lookups like:

```python
products = client.products.filter(product__category__name__ilike='"*saas services*"')
```

#### Using the `R` object

The `R` object allows to create complex RQL filter expression.

The `R` constructor allows to specify lookups as keyword arguments
the same way you do with the `filter()` method.

But it allows also to specify nested fields using the `.` notation:

```python
flt = R().product.category.name.ilike('"*saas services*"')

products = client.products.filter(flt)
```

So an expression like:

```python
flt = R().product.category.name.ilike('"*saas services*"')

products = client.products.filter(flt, status__in=('draft', 'published'))
```

will result in the following RQL query:

```python
and(ilike(product.category.name,"*saas services*"),in(status,(draft,published)))
```

The `R` object also allows to join filter expressions using logical `and` and `or` and `not`
using the `&`, `|` and and `~` bitwise operators:

```python
query = (
    R(status='published') | R().category.name.ilike('*awesome*')
) & ~R(description__empty=True)
```

## Other RQL operators

### Searching

For endpoints that supports the RQL search operator you can specify
your search term has shown below:

```python
with_search = rs.search('term')
```

### Ordering

To apply ordering you can specify the fields that have to be used to order the results:

```python
ordered = rs.order_by('+field1', '-field2')
```

Any subsequent calls append other fields to the previous one.

So the previous statement can also be expressed with chaining:

```python
ordered = rs.order_by('+field1').order_by('-field2')
```

### Apply RQL `select`

For collections that supports the `select` RQL operator you can
specify the object to be selected/unselected the following way:

```python
with_select = rs.select('+object1', '-object2')
```

Any subsequent calls append other select expression to the previous.

So the previous statement can also be expressed with chaining:

```python
with_select = rs.select('+object1').select('-object2')
```
